### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

### Links

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://your-live-site-url.com)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This was an awesome project for practicing. Finally used css grid. I also found my way of naming css variables. I learned that the mobile first approach is much better, because afterwards it's easier to adjust elements for bigger screens. I also experienced with this project for the first time what is like to work with a nicely created design file, it makes wiriting code much easier and faster.

### Continued development

I still struggle with media queries. It took most of my time. I need to find a better, faster method.
